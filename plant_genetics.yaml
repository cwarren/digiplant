particle_injection_max_radius_factor: 1.6 
# as a multiplier of the maximum radius of the plant (i.e the growth point furthest from the center of the seed); the larger, the more spreading the plant and the longer the run time
# NOTE: generally, you want the max to be > 1 and < 3, but you can go higher if you want; higher means sparser, lower means denser

particle_injection_min_radius_factor: 0.8
# as a multiplier of the maximum radius of the plant (i.e the growth point furthest from the center of the seed); the larger, the more spreading the plant and the longer the run time
# NOTE: min radius factor of < 1 will increase density, and also make things run faster
# NOTE: the higher the proportion of the injection ring that overlaps the plant radius, the denser the structure

particle_movement_max_radius_extension: 20
# as an addition to the PARTICLE_INJECTION_RADIUS; the larger, the more spreading the plant and the longer the run time
